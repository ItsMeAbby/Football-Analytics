# üèüÔ∏è Match Analysis Tabs (in `match_overview_simple.py`)

## üìç Shot Maps

### 1. Data

- Event-level data from StatsBomb via `load_match_data(match_id)`
- Filtered for events where `type == "Shot"`
- We extract `location` (x,y), `shot_statsbomb_xg`, and `shot_outcome`.

### 2. How & Why

- We draw a custom soccer pitch (Plotly shapes) and overlay shot markers.
- Marker **size** ‚àù xG, **color/symbol** by outcome, **hover** shows xG & outcome.
- Rationale: scatter on pitch gives exact spot and quality of each attempt.

### 3. Alternatives

- Heat-map of shot density
  - pro: highlights shooting ‚Äúhotspots‚Äù
  - con: loses individual shot quality and outcome detail
- Zonally aggregated bar chart (‚Äúshot zones‚Äù)
  - pro: easily comparable across predefined zones
  - con: arbitrary zones may hide nuances
- Temporal shot chart
  - pro: shows when shots occurred
  - con: loses spatial exactness

### 4. Our Advantage

- Precise spatial & quality representation (xG)
- Intuitive color/symbol encoding of outcome
- Interactive hover for player-level detail

### 5. Preprocessing

- Filter `events_df[type=="Shot"]`
- If `team_name` or `player_name` specified, further filter by nested dict lookup
- Extract coordinate arrays, xG, outcomes

### 6. Extra Notes

- We explicitly do **not** show own goals on shot map (they aren‚Äôt recorded as shots).
- Marker size scaling uses a linear transform for visibility.

---

## üîó Pass Networks

### 1. Data

- All successful passes (`type=="Pass"` & `pass_outcome` is NaN) for one team
- Related substitutions to map subbed-on players back to originals.

### 2. How & Why

- Compute pairwise pass counts between players ‚Üí graph edges
- Compute average field position for each player ‚Üí graph nodes
- Edge width‚àùfrequency, node size‚àùtotal involvement (passes in+out), position labeled by role acronym.
- Rationale: network graph reveals team shape & passing relationships.

### 3. Alternatives

- Chord diagram
  - pro: elegant circular layout
  - con: spatial relationship (field shape) lost
- Heat map of passes between zones
  - pro: highlights zones rather than individuals
  - con: no per-player insight
- Sankey diagram
  - pro: clear flows
  - con: linear layout not spatial

### 4. Our Advantage

- Nodes positioned on pitch ‚Üí intuitive spatial tactics
- Interactive hover reveals exact counts & sub info
- Distinct node shapes/colors mark substitutes vs starters

### 5. Preprocessing

- Filter events, map substitutions
- Build list of (`passer`, `recipient`) and count frequencies
- Compute average x,y per player (including sub replacements)
- Threshold edges at 15% of max pass frequency to declutter

### 6. Extra Notes

- Dynamic thresholding ensures small messy links are pruned.
- Substitution mapping preserves continuity of passing stats.

---

## üìà xG Timeline

### 1. Data

- All shots sorted by minute; `shot_statsbomb_xg`, `shot_outcome`.
- Also ‚Äúown goal‚Äù events from `Own Goal For/Against` types.

### 2. How & Why

- Cumulative sum of xG over match minutes plotted as line for each team
- Vertical dashed lines + annotations mark goals & own-goals.
- Rationale: shows match momentum and whether score matches chance creation.

### 3. Alternatives

- Rolling xG difference chart
  - pro: directly shows advantage swings
  - con: less intuitive for raw momentum build
- Bar chart of xG per interval
  - pro: quantifies each period
  - con: loses continuous story

### 4. Our Advantage

- Continuous cumulative view is familiar & easy to read
- Goal markers annotated in-chart, no separate legend needed
- Handles simultaneous goals/own-goals elegantly

### 5. Preprocessing

- Filter shots, sort by `minute`
- cumsum of `shot_statsbomb_xg` per team
- Insert start (0,0) and end (90, last_xg) points for full axis coverage
- Process related events to capture own-goals without duplication

### 6. Extra Notes

- Handles multiple goals at same minute with offsets
- Own goals require scanning related event IDs.

---

## üìä Match Stats (Side-by-side bars)

### 1. Data

- Counts from `events_df`: shots, fouls, goals, own goals, etc.
- Computed xG sums and shot types.

### 2. How & Why

- For each metric (e.g. Shots, xG, Pass Accuracy), draw two horizontal bars side-by-side
- Value labels inside bars, color coded by winner/loser.
- Rationale: immediate side-by-side quantitative comparison.

### 3. Alternatives

- Radar chart
  - pro: multi-variate in single spider
  - con: prone to misinterpretation, not precise
- Table
  - pro: exact numbers
  - con: no visual emphasis

### 4. Our Advantage

- Bars are intuitive, length proportional
- Color duality signals advantage at a glance
- Narrative description accompanies the chart

### 5. Preprocessing

- Compute home vs away metrics with dict lookups & Pandas filters
- Derive pass accuracy = successful/total passes √ó100
- Compute possession via pass share

### 6. Extra Notes

- Designed to fit in fixed-width container.
- Alternate visualizations are documented in info pop-ups.

---

## üéØ Key Events

### 1. Data

- Events of types: Shot goals, own goals, cards, fouls, substitutions from `events_df`.

### 2. How & Why

- Build chronological list of event‚Äêdicts with `minute`, `type+icon`, `team`, `player`, `description`
- Render as styled cards in scrollable panel.
- Rationale: narrative timeline of match turning points

### 3. Alternatives

- Gantt-style timeline
  - pro: relative spacing clear
  - con: more complex to implement in Dash & limited vertical real estate
- Event scatter on minute axis
  - pro: compact
  - con: loses rich textual description

### 4. Our Advantage

- Full descriptions, team-color backgrounds, icons ‚Üí immediately understandable
- Scrollable for many events

### 5. Preprocessing

- Consolidate `Shot`‚ÜíGoal events, map own goals via related IDs
- Detect cards via multiple columns (`bad_behaviour_card`, `type` in `Yellow Card`, etc.)
- Foul and substitution events appended

### 6. Extra Notes

- Robust card detection attempts multiple columns to cover StatsBomb schema variations.

---

## üí∞ Formations (Matplotlib + mplsoccer)

### 1. Data

- Starting XI and tactics from sbopen (`event`, `tactics`), ball receipts for heatmap.

### 2. How & Why

- Use `mplsoccer.VerticalPitch.formation` to draw nominal formation
- Overlay KDE‚Äêbased heatmaps of actual ball receipts per position
- Player name labels beside each KDE subplot
- Rationale: compares nominal shape vs real positional tendencies

### 3. Alternatives

- Static diagram of shapes only
  - pro: simple
  - con: no movement patterns
- Full tracking heatmap
  - pro: precise movement
  - con: not available in StatsBomb event data

### 4. Our Advantage

- Combines official formation graphic with real event-based density
- Vertical layout conserves horizontal space

### 5. Preprocessing

- Merge `event` & `tactics` on starting XI event ID
- Filter receipts only for starters, map 3+ word names to first+last
- Compute KDE for each position

### 6. Extra Notes

- Formation offsets defined per formation to avoid subplot overlap.
- Falls back gracefully if no starting XI or receipt events.

Each of these visualizations is backed by careful preprocessing, leverages both Plotly (for interactivity) and mplsoccer/Matplotlib (for publication-quality static images), and was chosen to maximize clarity, spatial intuition, and tactical insight. The code also includes fallbacks and graceful error handling for missing data, and in-app documentation (‚ÑπÔ∏è pop-ups) to explain the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind each choice.
