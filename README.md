- **Pass Network Analysis**: Force-directed graph layouts with spatial positioning revealing team structure and player relationships. Node sizes represent passing involvement, edge thickness indicates pass frequency, with position acronym labels
- **Expected Goals Timeline**: Cumulative line charts with goal annotations showing match momentum and xG progression throughout match duration
- **Match Statistics**: Symmetric horizontal bar charts for direct team comparison, with metrics categorized by type (possession, shooting, passing, defensive)
- **Key Events Timeline**: Chronological visualization of goals, cards, and substitutions with color-coded team identification and temporal layout
- **Formation Analysis**: Individual player activity density plots using mplsoccer's formation grid system, with KDE plots showing movement patterns based on Ball Receipt events

### üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Player Performance Dashboard
- **Hierarchical Selection Interface**: Four specialized visualization tabs for individual player analysis
- **Shot Analysis**: Player-specific shot maps with spatial accuracy using mplsoccer coordinates, quality encoding through circle sizes, and outcome differentiation with distinct icons
- **Touch Heatmaps**: Grid-based spatial analysis using 6x5 standardized zones (30 regions) with percentage quantification and white-to-red gradient intensity mapping
- **Progressive Actions Analysis**: Horizontal bar charts showing forward ball progression (10+ meters toward goal) with team context and ranking visualization
- **Performance Metrics - Dual Radar Innovation**: Separates volume metrics (goals, shots, passes, dribbles, duels, interceptions) from success rate metrics (pass accuracy, shot accuracy, duel success) with color distinction and multi-player overlay capability

### ‚öΩ Tactical Analysis Component
- **Formation Analysis**: Team shape and player positioning with average position calculation, formation-specific offset algorithms, and role-based color coding
- **Defensive Actions Analysis**: Spatial analysis of tackles, interceptions, blocks, and clearances with density heatmapping and success rate overlays
- **Attacking Patterns**: Final third activity analysis (x > 80) with spatial mapping of shots, dribbles, key passes, and crosses
- **Set Piece Analysis**: Comprehensive evaluation of corners, free kicks, and throw-ins with frequency analysis, spatial distribution, and effectiveness metrics
- **Team Comparison**: Symmetric horizontal bar charts with normalized scaling for tactical metrics comparison
- **Pass Length Distribution & Event Timeline**: Secondary visualizations showing team passing patterns and match activity distribution

### üîç Event Explorer Interface
- **Comprehensive Filtering System**: Filter by team, player, event type, and time range with real-time updates
- **Event Timeline**: Temporal distribution visualization with activity peak identification and dynamic filtering integration
- **Event Heatmap**: Spatial density visualization using mplsoccer coordinates with density gradient encoding and filter integration
- **Event Distribution**: Categorical analysis of nine event types with team comparison and frequency ranking
- **Interactive Data Table**: Dynamic column display with native filtering, pagination (20 events per page), and CSV export functionality
- **Summary Statistics**: Real-time filtered dataset context including event counts, player involvement, dominant event types, and temporal windows
