## üìä Data Source

This dashboard uses **StatsBomb's free Euro 2024 dataset**, which includes:
- All 51 matches from the tournament
- Detailed event data (passes, shots, tackles, etc.)
- Player and team information
- Advanced metrics like Expected Goals (xG)
- Positional data for tactical analysis

## üé® Dashboard Design and Visualization Strategy

### Match Overview Components
- **Shot Maps**: Interactive scatter plots showing shot locations with size encoding for Expected Goals (xG) value. This visualization choice allows users to quickly identify shot quality beyond mere position, with larger circles representing higher-probability chances. Color-coding differentiates outcomes (goals, saved shots, missed), providing immediate pattern recognition of shooting effectiveness.

- **Pass Networks**: Force-directed graph visualization revealing team shape and passing connections. Players appear as nodes with position-based labels, while edges represent passing connections with line thickness proportional to passing frequency. This approach reveals tactical structure more effectively than traditional heatmaps by highlighting key playmakers and team connectivity.

- **xG Timeline**: Cumulative line chart displaying Expected Goals (xG) progression through the match. This visualization method was selected over bar charts to better illustrate momentum shifts and periods of dominance. Vertical markers for actual goals provide context for conversion efficiency and pivotal moments.

- **Match Stats**: Horizontal comparative bar charts for team metrics. This side-by-side approach was chosen over radar charts for its clearer quantitative comparisons while maintaining consistent color-coding for team identification. The custom design ensures precise value display within a compact visual footprint.

- **Key Events**: Chronological timeline using card-based event visualization. Events are color-coded by team with standardized icons (‚öΩ,üü®,üü•,üîÑ) for rapid pattern recognition. This sequential approach preserves match narrative better than categorized groupings would.

- **Formations**: Kernel density estimation overlaid on pitch diagram showing positional tendencies. This hybrid approach combines the familiarity of traditional formation diagrams with the analytical depth of heatmaps, revealing both tactical setup and player movement ranges.

### Design Principles & Visualization Choices
- **Consistent Visual Language**: Standardized color coding across visualizations (green for positive outcomes, red for negative) to reduce cognitive load and increase learnability.
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex visualizations include collapsible detailed explanations that reveal design rationale, alternatives considered, and interpretation guidance.
- **Coordinated Views**: Related visualizations share consistent x-axes, color schemes, and interaction paradigms to facilitate cross-visualization insights.
- **Hierarchical Information Architecture**: Most important metrics are emphasized through size, position, and color contrast while maintaining accessibility guidelines.
- **Perception-Driven Design**: Visualization types chosen based on specific analytical tasks - scatter plots for positional data, line charts for temporal trends, bar charts for comparisons.

### Technical Implementation
- **Data Preprocessing Pipeline**: Event data is normalized, filtered, and aggregated before visualization to ensure optimal performance.
- **Modular Component Structure**: Dashboard components are encapsulated for reusability and maintainability.
- **Real-time Interactions**: Callbacks enable dynamic data filtering and cross-visualization highlighting without page reloads.
- **Memory Optimization**: LRU caching and lazy loading of data minimize memory footprint for large datasets.
- **Error Resilience**: Graceful degradation when data is incomplete or unavailable, with informative error messages.
